# Old Times Corfu

This is an attempt to assist my dear friend Arathymos with his business by providing
online support for his restaurant's menu. For this project the following tools are used.

## Toolkit

Undoubtedly, one of the best ways to build a typesafe Next.js app is `create-t3-app`.
So, by using it on my terminal I added support for:

1. **Typescript**: allows the development of typesafe javascript apps
2. **Tailwind CSS**: utility-first CSS framework
3. **Prisma**: ORM for relational databases. Provides auto-completion, automated migrations and typesafety.

To implement the app I also used the following data-related tools:

4. **PostgreSQL**: for the relational database
5. **AWS-RDS**: host the database
6. **pgAdmin**: easy access to the database by the businessmen
7. **Cloudflare**: to buy the custom domain
